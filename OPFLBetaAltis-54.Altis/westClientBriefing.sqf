Commanders Intent:   Conduct full spectrum operations and maintain presence in the AoR to destroy enemy forces. All elements from the 2nd HBCT are currently located at the FOB<br/>.

A. Concept of Operations:   Ground forces will move in and establish a COP on terrain that will provide a height advantage. Supplies will be moved to that location. Air and armored assets will provide support when requested. FIRES support will be available, CIVCAS is not a consideration as no civilians are in the area. Units that need to move from the FOB to the airstrip will utilize the map board to be transported ASAP.<br/><br/>  

B. Task to Subordinate Units.<br/><br/>

(1)   1PLT / A Co / 1 Bn / 18th Infantry Regiment<br/>

(a)   Secure the location of COP depending on the ground commanders instructions as vehicle assets allow.<br/>

(b)   Fortify location of friendly COP<br/>

(c)   Maintain security at COP location<br/>

(d)   Destroy enemy COPs in AoR<br/><br/>

(2)   1PLT / A Co / 1 Bn / 63rd Armor Regiment<br/>

(a)   Mount M1A1s and Strykers from the FOB and begin the movement into the AoR.<br/>

(b)   Provide support to units of the 18th INF Reg and 3rd SFG<br/><br/>

(3)   1st Aviation Regiment<br/>

(a)   Move to the airstrip and take off with respective aircraft.<br/>

(b)   Provide air support to ground forces.<br/>

(c)   Maintain air superiority.<br/><br/>

(4)   3rd SFG<br/>

(a)   Move into the AoR from the FOB and disrupt enemy combat operations.<br/>

(b)   Disrupt enemy supply operations.<br/>

(c)   Locate leadership of enemy forces.<br/><br/>

C.   Coordinating Instructions.<br/>

(1)   Before the start of operations create a battle plan utilizing the different assets in conjunction with the infantry forces on the ground while incorporating CAS (Close Air Support), CCA (Close Combat Attack), and ground based FIRES.<br/>

(2)   All FIRES will be cleared with the ground commander to prevent fratricide.<br/><br/>

4.   Service and Support.<br/>

Key Tasks:<br/>

a.   Fuel and Ammunition (Green Crates) must be transported to the COP to ensure CSW (Crew Served Weapons), vehicle weapons, and individual weapon systems are supplied with ammunition. Green crates will also provide medical support to personnel and maintenance (fuel and repair) to vehicles and aircraft. Using the action menu soldiers can move and load these supplies into vehicles for transport.<br/>

b. COP Supplies (Wooden Crates) must be transported to the COP to ensure adequate cover is provided for protection of the COP.<br/>

c. Flag(s) must be transported to ensure the 2nd HBCT gains 1 ticket per every 10 seconds. When moving the flag 1 ticket per 20 seconds is lost. Enemy forces will maintain the same system of tickets. 12 minutes into the operation the flag will be dropped off at the airfield. This time should be utilized to create the COP. Depending on the number of total combatants, the number of flags will change.<br/><br/>

5.   Command and Signal<br/>

a. Command.   Player in the commanders slot will maintain command over all units under the 2nd HBCT.<br/>

b. Signal.   Primary communications will be in-game VOIP or 3rd party VOIP. ArmA: Theatre of War's TS3 IP is ts3.arma-tow.com:9987. Secondary will be in-game chat.<br/>
