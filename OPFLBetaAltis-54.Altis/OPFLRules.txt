3. If the game clock says "Waiting for Players", then you are simply playing a team deathmatch and you can earn dog tags. During the "Waiting for Players" phase, the Ranking system is turned off. The waiting phase is a fun way of earning dog tags while the server fills up. However, RULES STILL APPLY.
